# Scoreboard Shortcuts

This app is a simple Electron app that responds to global shortcuts and edits the contents of two files: `home_score.txt` and `away_score.txt` either by increasing the number, decreasing the number or resetting to 0.

I built this app to accompany me with OBS & Elgato Stream Deck when streaming sports events. I have mapped Stream Deck buttons into those shortcuts and read files into OBS to display score.

## Run locally
